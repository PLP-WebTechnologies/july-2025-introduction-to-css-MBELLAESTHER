            <h2> What Does It Mean To Be Lukewarm?</h2>
            <p id="def"> Being "lukewarm" refers to a state of indifference or lack of commitment, 
                especially in a spiritual context. In the Bible, it is often associated with 
                being neither hot (passionate) nor cold (opposed), but rather in a tepid state 
                that lacks zeal.
            </p>
            <p id="def-con"> In a broader sense, being lukewarm can describe a person who is apathetic or
                unenthusiastic about their beliefs, values, or actions. This term is often used
                to encourage individuals to be more decisive and committed in their faith or 
                endeavors, rather than remaining in a state of complacency or indifference.
            </p>
            <p id="con"> In everyday language, calling someone "lukewarm" might imply that they are not
                 fully engaged or invested in a particular situation, whether it be a relationship,
                  a job, or a cause. It suggests a need for greater passion and dedication.

            <h3> Biblical Reference</h3>
           
                <dl id="bib-ref">
                    <dt>The primary reference to lukewarmness is found in Revelation 3:15-16 (NIV):</dt>
                        <div class="biblical-ref">
                            <dd>"I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one
                                or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to 
                                spit you out of my mouth."</dd>
                        </div>
                </dl>
            
                        
                    </p>
                    <p> This passage is part of a message to the church in Laodicea, where Jesus criticizes 
                        the congregation for their lack of fervor and commitment. The metaphor of being 
                        "lukewarm" is used to illustrate the undesirable state of being indifferent or 
                        half-hearted in one's faith.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Meaning</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Indifference: Lukewarm individuals may claim to follow Christ but lack true commitment or enthusiasm for their faith.</li>
                        <li>Warning: The passage serves as a warning against complacency in one’s spiritual life, urging believers to be fully devoted.</li>
                        <li>Call to Action: It encourages self-examination and a renewed commitment to faith and good works.</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>In essence, being lukewarm signifies a need for a deeper, more passionate relationship with God.</p>
